<h2>Welcome To CFLib.org</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Common Function Library Project. The purpose of the Common Function Library Project (CFLib.org) is to create a set of user-defined function (UDF) libraries
for ColdFusion 5.0 and higher. These libraries are open source and may be used and modified to your liking. Functions range from email format checking to encryption routines. 
These UDFs can greatly speed up development time as well as add new and powerful features to your web site.
</p>

<p>
Anyone can add their code to the project by simply using our <a href="/submit">submission form</a>. You must be running ColdFusion 5.0 (or higher) to run these libraries. For more information 
about ColdFusion, please visit <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/coldfusion">Adobe's ColdFusion</a> product page. If you have any suggestions or comments, 
please <a href="/contact">contact</a> me.
</p>	

<p>
CFLib.org was created by <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com">Raymond Camden</a>. 
UDF editing, approval and grunt work done by <a href="http://adamcameroncoldfusion.blogspot.co.uk/">Adam Cameron</a>.
